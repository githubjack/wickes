Question 1: Can you describe your ideal workflow when it comes to front-end development? 
State what tools you use, any resources you might seek help from and anything 
else that might help you speed up development time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
My ideal work-flow would consist of the following tools.
Design: Adobe XD or Figma for mockups and designs.
VS Code or Brackets for development; more brackets for quick prototypes and VS code for the heavy lifting. 
My browser will be ready to answer questions from sites like, CSS Tricks, smashing magazine, as well as get notifications from site point, egg heads and scotch.io amongst many other resources.
I would also have a sandbox like codeine or js fiddle running to test ideas.
Tech like react / vue / style components / cssnext and jam stack excite me.


Question 2: Can you explain a time where you have used both your 
creative imagination and technical skills to produce a piece of work?

My current freelance assignment, I produce mockups in photoshop for recruitment campaigns, 
tailored to the end client, then on approval of the design I build the page(s) 
using HTML CSS and JS then plug the page components into their Oracle database.
